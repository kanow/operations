================

The extension were build to manage firefighter operations in a TYPO3 website. The data for operations
are managed in :ref:`TYPO3 Backend <t3start:concepts>` by editors. Many detailed information e.g. used vehicles, recources, assistance
and more are possible. This extension can be used for other institutions like THW, police or security agencys too.
Different views in :ref:`Frontend <t3start:concepts>` possible.

.. note::

   Views in :ref:`Frontend <t3start:concepts>`:

   - List/single view of reports
   - filter by type, year and category or text
   - Show location on a map in single view
   - Map with all locations instead of normal list view
   - Statistics by operation type with a bar chart (made with `Chart.js <https://chartjs.org>`_)


.. tip::

   Extension `FireDepartment <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/fire_department>`_ can be used
   as :ref:`Site Package <t3sitepackage:start>`.
   Styles already optimized for operation default templates.
