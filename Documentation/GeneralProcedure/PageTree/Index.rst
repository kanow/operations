Suggested Page Tree
===================

Here is an example page tree for a firefighter website.
This is just a proposal for you and can be different to your site. I suggest
at least a sysfolder for the data,
and pages for list and single views for the things you need.

The news folder in my screen is just there in my develop environment and
not needed to get the extensions running.

You should create the page tree before start to configure the TypoScript
settings. Often you need uids from pages they are important for the
configuration.

.. note::

   The pages for the single views should be hidden in menu. You can set this
   in the page properties with and disable the switch "Page enabled in menus".
