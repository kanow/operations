Installing operations
=====================

You can install `operations` in different ways. They can be changed and depends on the used TYPO3 version.
Therefore you should follow the documentation how extensions can be installed in TYPO3.

The installation with composer is the preferred way for modern TYPO3 Installations. I described this already in
:ref:`Installation <installation>` chapter.

.. tip::

   You find detailed information about installing extensions with composer here
   in the TYPO3 documentation
   :ref:`Getting Started <t3start:installing-extensions>`.

I don't prefer the old way to install the extension in the TYPO3 Extension Manager. If you still use this installation
method, you can find infos here: :ref:`Managing Extensions - Legacy Guide <t3coreapi:extensions-legacy-management>`.

After installing `operations`, the next steps are to load and configure the TypoScript.
That is necessary to get `operations` working. I described this already here in the docs:
:ref:`TypoScript Configuration <typoscript-configuration>`.
