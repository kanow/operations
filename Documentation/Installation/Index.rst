Installation
============


There are various ways to install the extension. The preferred way is the installation with :ref:`Composer <t3tmsa:tmsa-Composer>`.

.. code-block:: bash

   composer require kanow/operations

Or you can clone it directly from github. Please check whether your are in correct branch or version afterwards.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone git@github.com:kanow/operations.git

The old way is downloading the extension in Extension Manager in TYPO3 backend or downloading a zip file
from https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/operations/ and upload those file in Extension Manager.

.. note::

   I'm only testing the installation method via composer.

You can find more information about installing TYPO3 Extensions in :ref:`Getting Started <t3start:extensions_index>` documentation of TYPO3.

.. note::

   Since TYPO3 version 11.5 it's not necessary to activate extensions after installing it with Composer.
